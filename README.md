## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Assumptions

- The watchlist is stored **locally** during the session; it does not persist after refresh.
- Search is performed both **locally** (watchlist) and via **API calls** if no matches are found.
- Heroes without images are replaced with a placeholder image to maintain card layout.
